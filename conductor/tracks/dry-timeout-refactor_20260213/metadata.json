  "description": "Good, it seems to work. But I'm noticing a lack of DRYness. You had to make the change in 2 places to reduce the timeout, and this should be defined in a single place. Addititionally, the menu that shows how much time was remaining showed "5m" meaning it wasn't able to support "seconds". Then further still, the resume modal still showed "30 minutes" as the extended time. This means if I ever adjust the default, it will be incorrect in many places. We need to make it DRY."
