## Who and Why

_If you've got HTML and someone who wants to see it, this is for you_.

The best time to test your changes is _before_ you merge them, but setting up a development environment on everyone's computer doesn't scale. The standard solution is to merge the code, and test it down the line in a staging environment where a simple bug might block the entire team from shipping. An emerging trend is to deploy each branch to an ephemeral environment, but this can be costly and time consuming to set up for all but the largest companies.

_Eyas_ leverages a packaged version of your application to provide a _simple_, shareable, and serverless testing solution that's ready to share within minutes. Regardless of your team size, you can now decrease the feedback loop for no extra cost. You can easily include PMs, designers, executives and customers in the testing process.

## Features

- üìà **Speed & Stability** - Ship faster and increase confidence in your application by testing _before merge_
- ü§ù **Shareability** - No special tools or configuration needed on your target machines. Share your demo with your team, company or even customers as a simple executable file.
- üì¶ **Serverless** - No need to manage a deployment server
- üîó **Cross-platform** - Test your application in multiple environments
- üí∞ **Cost** - Free to implement

## Install

```bash
# Install the package
npm install @cycosoft/eyas --save-dev
```

## Configuration

```js
// <projectRoot>/eyas.config.js
module.exports = {
  test: {
    // The path to the directory containing your application files
    source: `dist`,
    // The port your application will be served on via localhost
    port: 3000,
    // Run your application from any domain locally instead of localhost
    domain: null,
    // Define custom routes for your test
    routes: [/* { from: `/my-route`, to: `/demo/alt` } */],
    // The name of your application
    title: `Eyas`,
    // The version of your application that was built. Defaults to current branch name.
    version: `<current-branch>`,
    // Additional screen sizes to test your application at
    viewports: [/* { label: `iPad Pro`, width: 1024, height: 1366 } */],
    // Custom links to display in the menu
    menu: [/* { label: `Cycosoft, LLC`, url: `cycosoft.com` } */]
  }
};
```

## Usage

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "interactive": "eyas", // Select from a list of available commands
    "quick": "eyas preview", // Preview the your app without compiling
    "share": "eyas compile" // Compiles the configured app to a distributable
  }
}
```

## Tips

- Add `eyas-*` to your `.gitignore` to prevent output from being committed to your repo
- Windows executables can sometimes be slower to launch due to Microsoft Defender
- This tool disables certain security features of the browser, **and should not be used in a production capacity.**
- If your app is using a custom domain and you'd like to test it in your browser via Eyas, you will need to add the domain to your `etc/hosts` file. See [this guide](https://www.ephost.com/account/index.php/knowledgebase/232/How-to-edit-your-Host-file.html) (no affiliation) for more information.
